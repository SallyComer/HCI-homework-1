This elevator panel is well designed and intitive.
I found it in an elevator in the University Medical Center.
The current floor and direction of travel are indicated using a grid of LEDs.
A beep is played when the elevator goes up or down a floor.
A floor that was selected and has not yet arrived to is indicated by the button for that floor being lit up.
Every button is labeled by a panel to its left, with the floor number shown using a raised section of white plastic, and also written in braille.
Ambiguity over whether floor 1 is the first floor above the ground floor or the ground floor is avoided, by the ground floor (floor 1) having a star on the label.
The button for the basement is set below the buttons for the above-ground floors, and in the middle instead of in line with any of them.
There are open door and close door buttons, which are on the same height.
There is an alert button, which is not on the same height as any other button.
There is a HELP button below some kind of screen.

It is possible that this elevator could be made more friendly to people who cannot see well by playing a recording saying something like "arrived at floor 3" instead of just the beeping sound, when the elevator arrives.
